# CARD
 The "CARDS" application allows users to register on the website, after which they can create appointments with a doctor and edit/delete their appointments.

After registration, users can choose a doctor from the available list of doctors. Each doctor's specialization and indications for which they can accept patients are listed on the website.

After selecting a doctor, users can fill out a form, specifying their personal information and the appointment date. A small form validation is performed to prevent the user from leaving blank fields or entering incorrect data.

The appointments created by the user are saved in a list on the website. Users can view their appointments, edit them, or delete them if they no longer need the appointment.
